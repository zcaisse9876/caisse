# Caisse - C++ library
This serves as a general purpose library that will emulate some of the standard library containers but with less
functionality. However, the library will aim to be as production ready as possible.

This mainly serves as C++ practice, but hopefully can be built into a useful library in the future.

In order to use in your project, move the /zmc directory into your desired file-system location and include the header file
zmc/caisse.h

## Containers

### zmc::pair<<T>T1, T2> - Pair structure for two generic data types

### zmc::forward_list<<T>T> - Node based singly-linked list of generic elements
